            <br>
            <p>For patients with breast cancer, their journey to healing may include both addressing physical needs and providing emotional support. After a mastectomy, women frequently have breast reconstruction to alleviate deformity of the breast. This constructs breasts that meet the patient\rquote s expectations aesthetically and psychologically. See how we can give back an element of normalcy to survivors.</p>

              <h2>Scar Treatment</h2>
              <br>

              <p>My goal is to help people feel more confident about themselves and their skin by safely and effectively treating skin damage. I work on scars that leave behind a harsh traumatic remembrance or simply that are visually undesirable.</p>

              <p>Micro-pigmentation is the process of depositing microns of colored pigment into the dermal layer of the skin. Micro-pigmentation is a complex pigmentation procedure often requiring several applications and techniques to create blending and natural appearance. This procedure is sought out by those (including both men and women) who wish to camouflage their scars by creating an even skin tone.</p>

              <p>Scars can be corrected or camouflaged. I use a instrument for a scar relaxation technique called “Raque” to levy the scar smooth and flat as needed with keloids or hypertrophic scars. These innovative techniques can be used to treat numerous cosmetic conditions from surgery scars to vitiligo.</p>

              <p>I help people with various effects of surgery scars, tummy tucks, face lifts, breast augmentation, accident scars, burns, vitiligo, stretch marks, sun damage, acne scars, areola restoration, keloids, cleft lip, birth marks, freckles, age spots, vitiligo, hypo-pigmentation, and hyper-pigmentation etc.</p>

              <h2>Tattoo Removal</h2>
              <br>
              <p>Saline/Salabrasion Tattoo Removal is a more natural yet effective alternative to laser tattoo removal. The cost of Saline/Salabrasion tattoo removal is often less expensive and less traumatic to the skin than laser, dermabrasion, and excision. This new technique is also much less painful the traditional laser or other methods.</p>
